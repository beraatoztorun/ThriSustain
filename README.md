- Hello, I am Afra Sudenaz Uslu. We are together with my teammate Beraat Ã–ztorun in the ThriSustain project. In this project, we are developing a mobile application in Dart language based on Flutter. We use Firebase, Google Cloud and Google Maps infrastructures in our application.

- Our project is a mobile application that aims to reduce food waste and encourage sustainable shopping habits. By coordinating between consumers, markets and donor organizations, it provides discounts on products approaching their expiration date, thus reducing waste and providing economic benefits.

- With this project, we aim to achieve solutions to the United Nations Sustainable Development goals "2- Zero Hunger" and "12- Responsible Consumption and Production". In this way, we aim to leave a great project to the future for a sustainable World.
